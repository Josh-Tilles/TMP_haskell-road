\begin{Exercise} [number=10]
  Show:
  \Question $\{ a \} = \{ b \} \textrm{ iff } a = b$,
  \Question $\{ a_1, a_2 \} = \{ b_1, b_2 \} \textrm{ iff: } a_1 = b_1 \land a_2 = b_2 \textrm{, or } a_1 = b_2 \land a_2 = b_1$.

  NOTE: these \emph{can} be formally answered!
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer} [number=10.1]
  Because $\{ a \}$ and $\{ b \}$ are both \term{singletons}, in order
  to test if the two sets are the same (by Extensionality and such) we
  only need to compare the element from one to the element from the
  other.
\end{Answer}

\begin{Exercise} [number=11]
  Explain that $\emptyset \neq \{\emptyset\}$. And that $\lbrace
  \emptyset \rbrace \neq \bigl\{\{ \emptyset \}\bigr\}$.
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
  First, remember the \term{Principle of Extensionality}: that a set
  is completely defined by its elements, and as such is equal to
  another set with the same elements.
	
  I'll start with showing why $\emptyset \neq \{\emptyset\}$. What are
  the contents of $\emptyset$? Nothing---which can also be seen in the
  fact that $\cardinality{\emptyset} = 0$.  In contrast,
  $\cardinality{ \{ \emptyset \} } = 1$ because it contains one
  element: the empty set!

  The same reasoning can be applied to the other two, because the
  first pair happen to be the respective contents of the second
  pair. Since sets are totally defined by their elements, and we've
  shown that the elements are not equal, then the respective enclosing
  sets are also not equal.
