  \Question Assume that $A$ and $B$ are non-empty and that $A \times B
  = B \times A$. Show that $A = B$.

  \Question Show by means of an example that the condition of
  non-emptiness in 1 (the previous part/Question) is necessary. (Did
  you use this in your proof of 1?)

  To show that defining $(a,b)$ as $\bigl\{ \{a\}, \{a,b\} \bigr\}$
  works, prove that:

  \Question $\{a, b\} = \{a, c\} \quad \implies \quad b = c$.
  \Question $\bigl\{ \{a\}, \{a, b\}\bigr\} = \bigl\{ \{x\}, \{x, y\}
  \bigr\} \qquad \implies \qquad a = x \land b = y$.
