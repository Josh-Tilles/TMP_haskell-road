\section{The Notion of a Relation}

\begin{Exercise} [number=13]
  Show that $\forall{x,y} \colon \exists{R} \suchThat xRy$. (``Between
  every two things there exist some relation''.)
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
  Well, suppose we have some arbitrary $x$ and $y$---well, there's
  nothing stopping us from creating an ordered pair $(x,y)$. Now
  observe that $\{(x,y)\}$ is a valid set. Thus, there is at least one
  set that contains an ordered pair comprising $x$ and $y$ as
  parts. Finally, note that $\{(x,y)\}$ satisfies the description of a
  relation. It's a set of ordered pairs. (The set's being a \term{singleton}
  is irrelevant in this circumstance.)
