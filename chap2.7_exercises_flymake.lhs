    (the propositional equivalent of this was in Exercise 2.19)
    Argue that $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ are equivalent iff $\Phi \iff \Psi$ is valid.

    For every sentence $\Phi$ in exercise 2.36, consider its negation $\neg\Phi$, and produce a more positive equivalent by working the negation symbol through the quantifiers.

    Does it hold that $\neg\exists{x} \in A \suchthat \Phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\exists{x} \notin A \suchthat \Phi(x)$? If your answer is `yes', give a proof; if `no', then you should show this by giving a simple refutation (an example of formulas and structures where the two formulas have different truth values).

\begin{Exercise} [number=47]
    Is $\exists{x} \notin A \suchthat \Phi(x)$ equivalent to $\exists{x} \in A \suchthat \neg\Phi(x)$? Give a proof if your answer is `yes', and a refutation otherwise.

    Produce the version of Theorem 2.40 that employs restricted quantification. Argue that your version is correct.

\begin{Exercise} [number=50]
    That the sequence $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots \in \reals$ converges to $a$, i.e., that $lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = a$, means that $forall{\delta} > 0 \colon \exists{n} \suchthat \forall{m \geq n} \colon \abs{a - a_M} < \delta$. Give a possible equivalent for the statement that the sequence $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots \in \reals$ does not converge.
